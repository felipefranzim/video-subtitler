1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,240
It isn't true what they say, that you can't love anyone until you love yourself.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Have you heard that?

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,600
Some people say you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anybody else.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,040
But it's not true.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,560
I loved everybody before I loved myself.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Love doesn't care which way you come or what state you're in when you get here.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,720
Love welcomes everyone unconditionally.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,160
Oddly, so do focus group moderators.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,759
Which is how and why I learned to do it.

10
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,000
If you've never been a part of a focus group, you're missing a really special cultural experience.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,240
In every focus group, there's a range of characters, right?

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,080
There's always a shy one and a chatty one, a grumpy one that doesn't want to do any of

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,080
the exercises, and a very excited mom with a notebook who wants to get an A plus in all

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,199
of the exercises.

15
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:21,000
There's a student who lied on the intake because they need the money, and a dad full of jokes

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,639
who can't read the room.

17
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:34,519
And usually, there's one ex-military guy who keeps staring at the two-way mirror suspiciously.

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,320
It's a situation where a group of people that may not otherwise ever meet have the chance

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,199
to share their perspectives.

20
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:46,400
And it's my job as the moderator to make sure that they all get heard.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,639
Now, it's not quite a classroom.

22
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,919
It's not group therapy.

23
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:55,800
And while the community feel has some elements of holiness, probably no one would call it

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,599
a spiritual experience.

25
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,160
I mean, no one else.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,959
Because moderating rooms of strange and difficult voices is what taught me to welcome all the

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,000
strange and difficult parts of myself.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,360
No kidding.

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,320
I start every morning meditation with the same opener I use as a focus group moderator.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,479
Thanks everyone for being here.

31
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,839
Your input is valued.

32
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,039
I'm going to hear from each of you.

33
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,800
I'll give you all the chance to speak.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:38,279
Just do your best to be completely present, honest, and try to make any requests reasonable.

35
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:43,360
So I don't know about you, but there are a lot of me in here in the mind of Karen Faith.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm not referring to psychiatric illness specifically.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,399
But I don't exclude that.

38
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,559
My mind has plenty of quirks.

39
00:02:53,559 --> 00:03:00,000
But what I have to share is for anyone with an inner dialogue, though I admit it's especially

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,600
for those of us with a really noisy one.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,399
So I noticed some time ago that I was arguing with myself.

42
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:12,919
And then I wondered, if I didn't agree with me, who is I and who is me?

43
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,080
In that scenario, and it turned out that there are quite a few of me.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,240
There's a really sentimental, emotional me, and an intellectual, analytical me.

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Those two argue a lot.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,679
There's a me who loves being on stage.

47
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:35,039
There's another one who's pretty shaky at the moment.

48
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,399
Some of us, at this time I include you, some of us regard these as feelings or thoughts.

49
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:44,880
And maybe we've done our personal homework accepting that we can have conflicting feelings

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,559
at the same time.

51
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,360
We can be excited about a new job and also dread going back to work.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,600
We can be tired and want to stay up.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,960
We can adore someone who also annoys us.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,520
We can love someone who has badly betrayed us.

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,880
We know this.

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,839
And when we're honest and rational, we can see that these are common experiences.

57
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,880
That we're not crazy to both love and hate camping.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,040
It does me no harm to embrace that I feel both ways about it.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,119
But what about the thought that I'm worthless?

60
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,519
That I don't belong here?

61
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,679
That the mistakes I've made are unforgivable?

62
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:32,079
That the bad things that happened in my life were my fault?

63
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:36,600
Those thoughts are just as real as the rest of them, but they're harder to live with.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,959
And they send many of us to therapy or to yoga or the nearest bar, which more or less

65
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,000
describes my daily commute for many years.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,519
Because I wanted to silence those thoughts completely.

67
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,880
And let me tell you, I tried.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,279
I have done every kind of therapy I have ever heard of.

69
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,519
I have done talk therapy, energy healing, body work, hypnotherapy, soul retrieval, the

70
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,399
tapping stuff, the thing with the lights.

71
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,799
I did seven kinds of yoga.

72
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:12,480
I drank the special tea with the shaman in the forest.

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:22,320
I admit I did pass on the acupuncture they do with live honeybees, but people do that.

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,880
Suffice to say, I tried.

75
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,000
And still sometimes when I was alone, I would hear myself shouting, shut up, or worse, to

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,279
my own mind.

77
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,760
In my work as a people researcher, it's my job to practice empathy with strangers.

78
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,160
To receive everything I can about their world in order to understand them as deeply as possible.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,640
Now, it's noteworthy that I found this career at a temp job writing meeting notes when my

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,320
supervisor noticed that I wasn't just paraphrasing conversation.

81
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,359
I was recording body language, microexpressions, tonal shifts, specific verb choices.

82
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:07,279
What neither of us knew then is that the qualities which made me seem skillful were the symptoms

83
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,000
of complex posttraumatic stress.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The most reasonable results of an appalling upbringing and a fact I share, not to set

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,679
me apart from you, but to welcome you in here with me.

86
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,140
Everyone in this room has walked through something difficult in order to be here.

87
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,660
And I want you to know that whatever path you've taken to get through it is honorable.

88
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,420
Whether you never talk about it, whether you write bad poetry about it, whether you make

89
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,660
tons of money prosecuting it, or if you just hit the gym like a champ to sweat it out of

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,959
your body, there is truly no wrong way.

91
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,380
There are some ways that cause other problems.

92
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,380
You know the ones.

93
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,980
I've done some of those.

94
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,940
I still do some of those.

95
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,739
And I don't judge those either.

96
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:59,779
Because gifts and curses are buy one, get one.

97
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,459
And mine were no exception.

98
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,619
My early life gave me heaps of shame and a splintered sense of self, hence all the different

99
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:07,619
me's.

100
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:12,059
But it also gave me super antennas for the emotions of others.

101
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:18,420
This hypervigilance made me a certified mess of a person, but a damn near wizard-level

102
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,859
observer.

103
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:20,859
So I got to work.

104
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:24,579
In the last 20 years, I've shadowed people in their homes, at their jobs, while they

105
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,059
shop and drive and go on dates.

106
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,540
I ask them to be honest and vulnerable with me.

107
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,500
And to do this, I practice something that I call unconditional welcome, which is like

108
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,420
a researcher's neutrality, but a little extra.

109
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,179
The day I discovered it, I was sitting in the living room of a research subject.

110
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:53,600
She was a very unpleasant woman, if I'm honest, feeding French fries to an infant as she snapped

111
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,739
at me that she would never have her children vaccinated.

112
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:01,019
Not even to protect them from polio, because she didn't know it was in those shots.

113
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:07,339
Now, never mind that she said this an inch of ash deep into a Virginia Slim, right?

114
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,420
I was judging her.

115
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
I know.

116
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,899
I'm not proud of it.

117
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,260
But at least one of me is a jerk.

118
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:21,339
So I needed to connect with her, and I didn't want to.

119
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,579
I didn't like her.

120
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,220
I didn't respect her.

121
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,100
I didn't want to spend a single moment with her.

122
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,219
And the project required that I spend hours, and that I use that time to get to know her,

123
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,260
what she values, what she believes, where she finds strength.

124
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,979
Researcher neutrality was unavailable to me at the time.

125
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,500
So I had to get out the big guns.

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I called up my new age visualization skills, and I took a deep breath, secondhand smoke

127
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,460
and all, and I imagine that my breath was inflating a shiny soap bubble filled with

128
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,020
unconditional welcome.

129
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,179
Not tolerance.

130
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:02,140
Not even compassion.

131
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,580
Total welcome, as is.

132
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,059
No comments, no notes.

133
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:10,219
And as I inflated the bubble, it became big enough to contain my whole body.

134
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:12,820
And then hers.

135
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:21,780
And in that moment, I saw a mother feeding her baby in a world that she didn't trust.

136
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,380
I told her that I could see that she cared about protecting her son, and I asked her

137
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,219
if she got that from her parents.

138
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:32,820
And then we had a conversation, and I learned about her.

139
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,780
I learned why she was afraid and angry, and how she fought through that fear to make a

140
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,099
family.

141
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:45,179
When I welcomed this woman unconditionally, I saw her more clearly, but I also loved her

142
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,500
instantly.

143
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,340
We have been told too often that love is hard.

144
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,679
It's not.

145
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,179
Love is what happens when we stop trying to figure out who deserves it.

146
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,179
It's right there.

147
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:05,260
When we stop trying to figure out who deserves it, and we welcome someone, anyone, exactly

148
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,979
as they are in the moment.

149
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:14,419
It will be two more years before I learn to do this with all the parts of myself.

150
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,900
But it started just as simply.

151
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:24,260
A part of me had become very chatty, a part that was afraid and angry, whiny, demanding,

152
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,380
unreasonable, and relentless.

153
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,900
She told me that we were never going to get better, and she wanted out of here.

154
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,539
I asked her what I could do.

155
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,380
She only told me she wanted to die, over and over and over and over.

156
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,140
I begged her to shut up, and she did not.

157
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,979
Finally, after weeks of harassment, whether out of exhaustion or epiphany, instead of

158
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:53,900
shouting back, I took a deep breath, I became my own moderator.

159
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,460
I said out loud, in a voice that surprised me, thank you for sharing.

160
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,619
I'm going to remind you of our agreement to be honest and reasonable.

161
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:07,619
She answered me.

162
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:08,619
That voice.

163
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:09,960
Now, don't get spooked.

164
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,780
This is all just thinking happening.

165
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,700
But the part of me asking and the part answering did, in fact, seem like different parts.

166
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,619
She told me that she was in a lot of pain, and I told her, I know, and I promise you

167
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,820
I'm going to take care of you, but I need you to get on board.

168
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,179
I will listen to you, but I will not obey you.

169
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:33,219
And as clearly as I'm speaking to you now, she said, okay.

170
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:36,219
And then we started to talk.

171
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:41,380
As I continued the dialogue with myself, I found more of me, more voices with more points

172
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:47,659
of view, some of them more fun than others, and the imagined landscape of my mind began

173
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:55,020
to look a lot like a focus group, this round table of wildly mixed characters and one moderator

174
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:02,380
keeping some kind of order with honesty, boundaries, kindness, and most importantly,

175
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
gratitude.

176
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,099
I thank myself for their contributions, no matter how bonkers or twisted they may seem,

177
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:11,419
because we're all me.

178
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:16,580
I think of my fragmented self less like a broken mirror and more like a prism.

179
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,700
We're a full spectrum.

180
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,820
Today there isn't a voice in my head that I don't welcome, and while some of us are

181
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,780
occasionally unreasonable, we're not mean.

182
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,299
Even my whiny, shamey voice is trying to help in her weird way, but when I ask her to be

183
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:35,820
clear and kind, she tells me exactly what I need to know, what she needs to feel better

184
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,539
and what she'd like for me to learn.

185
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:43,520
But just like the scared and angry mother, she only does this when I accept her exactly

186
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,780
as she is in the moment.

187
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,539
So while my openings for self talk and focus groups sound almost identical, the closings

188
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,820
are a little different.

189
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,539
At the round table, I would hand out parking validation and remind everyone to sign for

190
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:03,940
their cash, but when I'm with all of me, I say, I love you.

191
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,340
Thank you for helping me see what you see, which is why this practice is so useful for

192
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,020
all of us here with our different perspectives inside and outside of one another.

193
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,880
If we can receive one another with the curiosity and welcome of a focus group moderator, perhaps

194
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,679
we can do a better job of love.

195
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,679
Because it is not true what they say, that you can't love anyone until you love yourself.

196
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,200
Love is a house you can crawl in through a window.

197
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,760
If you can't start with yourself, start with the person next to you right now, whether

198
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,320
you know them or not.

199
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,440
All you have to do is let them be here.

200
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,679
It's easy, isn't it?

201
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:48,520
Wherever they've been, whatever they're carrying, whatever talents they have or don't have,

202
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,960
whatever mistakes they've made, can you just welcome them here?

203
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,799
Can you welcome you?

204
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,760
We're here right now like this.

205
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,280
We're beautiful and strange and complicated and scared and sometimes kind of horrible,

206
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,960
but all of us are worthy of welcome.

207
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,559
And everyone that you show unconditional welcome may show you a part of yourself to love.

208
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,559
You are welcome.

209
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,559
Thank you.

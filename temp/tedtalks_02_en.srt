1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,520
That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,400
and water.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,959
When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out

5
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,880
of that barrel.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,840
Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,400
Instead, it looks like this.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,160
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,959
be a highly infectious virus, rather than a war.

10
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,000
Not missiles, but microbes.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,160
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrence.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,120
We've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,040
We're not ready for the next epidemic.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,559
Let's look at Ebola.

15
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:26,199
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper.

16
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,199
Lots of tough challenges.

17
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:35,760
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we used to track polio eradication.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,800
And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,239
work well enough.

20
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,720
The problem was that we didn't have a system at all.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,959
In fact, there are some pretty obvious key missing pieces.

22
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,519
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone, seen what

23
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,760
the disease was, seen how far it had spread.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,000
The case reports came in on paper.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,559
It was very delayed before they were put online, and they were extremely inaccurate.

26
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,759
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

27
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,119
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

28
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:18,759
Now, Medicine Sans Frontieres did a great job orchestrating volunteers, but even so,

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,000
we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,399
countries.

31
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:31,399
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

32
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,919
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches, no one to look at the diagnostics,

33
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,320
no one to figure out what tools should be used.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,399
As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,759
back in people to protect them, but that was never tried.

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:00,240
So there was a lot that was missing, and these things are really a global failure.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,919
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.

38
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,839
Now in the movies, it's quite different.

39
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:14,800
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,080
They move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,279
The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating

42
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,800
than Ebola.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,399
Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.

44
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:43,880
About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries.

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,600
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,720
The first is there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.

47
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
They found the people and they prevented more infections.

48
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,039
The second is the nature of the virus.

49
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,279
Ebola does not spread through the air, and by the time you're contagious, most people

50
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,639
are so sick that they're bedridden.

51
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,339
Third, it didn't get into many urban areas, and that was just luck.

52
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:18,179
If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger.

53
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,459
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

54
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,579
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they

55
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,059
get on a plane or they go to a market.

56
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:34,859
The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism.

57
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:39,339
And so there are things that would literally make things 1,000 times worse.

58
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:47,339
In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air like the Spanish flu

59
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,899
back in 1918.

60
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,540
So here's what would happen.

61
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,579
It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.

62
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:00,700
And you can see there's over 30 million people die from that epidemic.

63
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,619
So this is a serious problem.

64
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,459
We should be concerned.

65
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:08,980
But in fact, we can build a really good response system.

66
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,820
We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.

67
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,179
We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them.

68
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:22,220
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.

69
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,260
We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

70
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,260
and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.

71
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,420
So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system,

72
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,700
and we need preparedness.

73
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,100
The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are, again, what we do for war.

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,820
For soldiers, we have full-time waiting to go.

75
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,500
We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,179
NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.

77
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:01,700
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well-trained?

78
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,100
Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies?

79
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,820
So they are absolutely ready to go.

80
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,700
So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.

81
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,579
What are the key pieces?

82
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,619
First is we need strong health systems in poor countries.

83
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:25,579
That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines,

84
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:30,059
but also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.

85
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:31,820
We need a medical reserve corps,

86
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,420
lots of people who've got the training and background,

87
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,859
who are ready to go with the expertise.

88
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:42,380
And then we need to pair those medical people with the military,

89
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,500
taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast through logistics and secure areas.

90
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,540
We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games,

91
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,420
so that we see where the holes are.

92
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,940
The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001,

93
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,660
and it didn't go so well.

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,420
So far, the score is germs one, people zero.

95
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,820
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

96
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,299
There are some big breakthroughs, like the Deno-associated virus,

97
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:21,299
that could work very, very quickly.

98
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:24,579
Now, I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,

99
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,700
but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.

100
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,660
The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

101
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,459
global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars,

102
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,859
and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.

103
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:46,859
These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic.

104
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:51,019
The primary health care, the R&D, those things would reduce global health equity

105
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:55,220
and make the world more just, as well as more safe.

106
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,820
So I think this should absolutely be a priority.

107
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,859
There's no need to panic.

108
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:05,579
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.

109
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:09,940
But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.

110
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,459
In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,

111
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:21,739
it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call to get ready.

112
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,059
If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.

113
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,059
Thank you.

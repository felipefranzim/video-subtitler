1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,160
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,340
was even more demanding, teaching.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,440
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,320
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework assignments.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,000
When the work came back, I calculated grades.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,320
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,599
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

8
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:54,560
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
And that got me thinking.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,599
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard, ratios, decimals,

11
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:07,620
the area of a parallelogram, but these concepts are not impossible.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,300
And I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,160
they worked hard and long enough.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,160
After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,000
is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective,

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
from a psychological perspective.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,360
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,180
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to

19
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,680
learn quickly and easily?

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,000
So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,320
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings.

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,620
And in every study, my question was, who is successful here and why?

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,639
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.

24
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,199
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop

25
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,639
out.

26
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,119
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest

27
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,080
in competition.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,559
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers

29
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:31,679
are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year?

30
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:37,759
And of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students?

31
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,520
We partnered with private companies, asking which of these salespeople is going to keep

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,960
their jobs, and who is going to earn the most money?

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,119
In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor

34
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,639
of success.

35
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,279
And it wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't

36
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,940
IQ.

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,320
It was grit.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,360
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,559
Grit is having stamina.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,759
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:23,320
the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,360
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,199
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago Public Schools.

44
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,119
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited

45
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:41,880
around more than a year to see who would graduate.

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,119
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched

47
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:54,580
them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,600
test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,119
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters, it's also

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,360
in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,199
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science

52
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,519
knows about building it.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,799
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids?

54
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,959
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?

55
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,040
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,760
The honest answer is, I don't know.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,880
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,559
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not

59
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,000
follow through on their commitments.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,720
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,679
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.

62
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:05,760
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,000
the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,279
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and

65
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,839
grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because

66
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,359
they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

67
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:35,160
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit, but we need more.

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,559
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are.

69
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,779
That's the work that stands before us.

70
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:46,700
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.

71
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:53,239
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,

72
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:56,600
to start over again with lessons learned.

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,519
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.

74
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,040
Thank you.

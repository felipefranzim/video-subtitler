1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Translator's note

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The human voice.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the instrument we all play.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's the only one that can start a war

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
or say, I love you.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And yet, many people have the experience that when they speak,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
people don't listen to them.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why is that?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How can we speak powerfully to make change

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in the world?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that we need to move away from.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I've assembled for your pleasure here

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
seven deadly sins of speaking.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but these seven, I think, are pretty large.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Habits that we can all fall into.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
First,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
gossip.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not a nice habit, and we know

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
perfectly well the person gossiping

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
five minutes later will be gossiping

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
about us.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Second, judging.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We know people who are like this in conversation,

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and it's very hard to listen to somebody

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
if you know that you're being judged

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and found wanting at the same time.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Third, negativity.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can fall into this.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My mother, in the last years of her life,

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
became very, very negative, and it's hard to listen.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I remember one day I said to her,

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it's October the 1st today, and she said,

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't like people.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's hard to listen

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
when somebody's that negative.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And another form of negativity,

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
complaining.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, this is the national art

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
of the UK.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's our national sport. We complain about the weather,

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
about sport, about politics, about everything,

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but actually complaining is viral misery.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not spreading sunshine

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and lightness in the world.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Excuses.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We've all met this guy.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We've all been this guy.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Some people have a blame thrower.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They just pass it on to everybody else

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and don't take responsibility for their actions.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And again, hard to listen to somebody who's being like that.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
embroidery.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Exaggeration.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It demeans our language, actually,

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
sometimes. For example, if I see something

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that really is awesome,

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
what do I call it?

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then, of course, this exaggeration

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
is lying, out and out lying,

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And finally,

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
dogmatism.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The confusion of facts

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
with opinions.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When those two things get conflated,

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you're listening in to the wind.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's difficult to listen to that.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So here they are,

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
seven deadly sins of speaking.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
These are things, I think, we need to avoid.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But is there a positive way

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to think about this? Yes, there is.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'd like to suggest that there are

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
four really powerful

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
cornerstones, foundations,

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that we can stand on if we want our

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
speech to be powerful

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and to make change in the world.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The word is hail, and it has

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
a great definition as well.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
definition, to greet or

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
acclaim enthusiastically, which is, I think,

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
words will be received if we stand

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
on these four things. So what do they stand for?

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
See if you can guess.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The H, honesty,

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
of course, being true

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in what you say, being straight and clear.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The A is authenticity,

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
just being yourself.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A friend of mine described it as

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
standing in your own truth, which I think

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
is a lovely way to put it.

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The I is integrity, being

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
your word, actually doing what you say,

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and being somebody people can trust.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the L is

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
love. I don't mean

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
romantic love, but I do mean

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
wishing people well.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
For two reasons. First of all, I think

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
absolute honesty may not be what we want.

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Perhaps

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that's not necessary.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tempered with love, of course,

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
honesty is a great thing. But also,

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
if you're really wishing somebody

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
well, it's very hard to judge

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
them at the same time. I'm not even

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, hail.

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Also, now that's

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
what you say, and it's like the old song,

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it.

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have an amazing

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
toolbox. This instrument is incredible,

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and yet this is a toolbox that very

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
few people have ever opened.

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just pull a few tools out that you might like to

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
take away and play with, which will

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
increase the power of your speaking.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Register, for example.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, falsetto register may not

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
be very useful most of the time,

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but there's a register in between.

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not going to get very technical about this for any

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
of you who are voice coaches. You can locate

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
your voice, however. So if I talk up

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
here in my nose, you can hear the difference.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If I go down here in my throat, which is where

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
most of us speak from most of the time,

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but if you want

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
weight, you need to go down here

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to the chest. You hear the difference?

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We vote for politicians

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
with lower voices.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's true. Because we associate

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
depth with power

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and with authority.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's register.

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And we have timbre. It's the

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
way your voice feels. Again, the research

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
shows that we prefer voices which are rich,

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
smooth, warm,

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
like hot chocolate.

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, if that's not you,

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that's not the end of the world.

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because you can train. Go get a voice

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
coach. And there are amazing things you

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
can do with breathing, with posture,

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
with exercises to improve the timbre

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
of your voice. Then

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
prosody. I love prosody. This is the

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
sing song, the metalanguage that we use

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in order to impart meaning. It's

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
root one for meaning in conversation.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
People who speak all on one

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
note are really quite hard to

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
listen to if they don't have any prosody

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at all. That's where the word

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
monotonic comes from, or

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
monotonous, monotone.

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Also, we have repetitive

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
prosody now coming in, where

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
every sentence ends as if it were a question.

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
When it's actually not a question, it's a

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
statement.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And if you

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
repeat that one over and over, it's actually

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
restricting your ability to communicate through

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
prosody, which I think is a shame.

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So let's try and break that habit.

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Pace.

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can get very, very excited by saying something really,

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
really quickly, or I can slow

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
right down to emphasize.

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And at the end of that,

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
of course, is our old friend silence.

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in a talk, is there?

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We don't have to fill it with ums

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and ahs. It can

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
be very powerful.

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course, pitch often goes along with

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
pitch. Where did you leave my keys?

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Where did you leave my keys?

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a slightly different

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
meaning in those two deliveries.

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And finally, volume.

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can get really excited

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
by using volume.

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Or I can have you really pay attention

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
by getting very quiet.

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Some people broadcast the

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
whole time, try not to do that.

208
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's called sodcasting.

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Imposing

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
your sound on people around you

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
carelessly and inconsiderately.

212
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not nice. Of course,

213
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
where this all comes into play, most of all,

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
is when you've got something really important to do.

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It might be standing on a stage like this

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
marriage, asking

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for a raise,

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a wedding speech, whatever it is.

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If it's really important, you owe it to yourself

221
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to look at this toolbox

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and the engine that it's going

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to work on. And no engine works well without

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
being warmed up. Warm up

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
your voice. Actually,

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
let me show you how to do that. Would you all like

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to stand up for a moment?

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to show you the six

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
vocal warm-up exercises that

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I do before every talk I ever

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
do. Anytime you're going to talk

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to anybody important, do these. First,

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
arms up.

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Deep breath in and sigh out.

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Like that. One more

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
time.

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Very good.

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now we're going to warm up our lips

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and we're going to go

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Very good. And now

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
just like when you were a kid.

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now your lips should be

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
with exaggerated

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Beautiful. You're getting

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
really good at this. And then roll an R.

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's like champagne for the tongue.

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Finally, and if I can only do one,

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the pros call this the siren.

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's really good. It starts with

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
we and goes to or. The we is high, the or is

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
low. So you go

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Fantastic.

254
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Give yourselves a round of applause.

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Take a seat. Thank you.

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Next time you speak, do those

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
in advance. Now, let me just put

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
this in context to close.

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is a serious point here.

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is where we are now, right?

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We speak not very well into people

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
who simply aren't listening in an environment

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that's all about noise and bad acoustics.

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I have talked about that on this stage

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in different phases.

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What would the world be like

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if we were speaking powerfully

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to people who are listening consciously

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in environments which were actually fit

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
for purpose? Or to make that a bit

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
larger, what would the world

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
be like if we were creating sound

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
consciously and consuming

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
sound consciously and designing

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
all our environments consciously

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
for sound? That would be a world

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that does sound beautiful

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and one where understanding

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
would be the norm.

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And that is an idea

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
worth spreading.

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you.

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.
